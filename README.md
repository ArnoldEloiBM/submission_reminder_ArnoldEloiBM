Submission Reminder App
a shell script named create_environment.sh that sets up the directory structure for an application called submission_reminder_app. Your script should create the necessary directories and files to simulate a real-world application environment. The application's source code will be provided as part of the assignment.

The Shell Script which you are supposed to create:
The shell script you are creating should be titled as create_environment.sh.
This script will create a directory called submission_reminder_{yourName}. The {yourName} represents your names, which means that when a user is running your script, it should first ask them for your name, and that name will be used when creating the directory

Create the Files:
The contents for reminder.sh, functions.sh, and config.env have been provided below to download and use. You will use them as references to create the respective files in the appâ€™s directory structure.
Follow the structure of submissions.txt  when adding more students. You must have added atleast 5 more student records so that we test the application more better.	

Implement the startup.sh Script:
One part of this assignment is for you to create your startup.sh script.
This script should contain logic that starts up the reminder app when executed.
Make the script executable

Once the environment has been created with the script test the application you just created by running the  startup.sh
